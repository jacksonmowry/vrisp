#+title: VRISP
This repo contains example applications utilizing the VRISP neuroprocesser, along with benchmarks comparing it to the current RISP implementation.

* Cloning
This repo utilizes git submodules, which require an additional flag when cloning.

#+begin_src console
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jacksonmowry/vrisp.git
#+end_src

* Buidling
The makefile does nothing fancy, it simply makes all of the dependencies and then the actual apps for the processors we will be testing. It will always rebuild the apps even if nothing has changed, but you shouldn't need to run =make= more than once anyways.

**

#+begin_src console
make
#+end_src
